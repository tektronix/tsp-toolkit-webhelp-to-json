            "details": "Reading this attribute returns the positive full-scale value of the measurement range that the SMU is currently using. Assigning a value to this attribute sets the SMU on a fixed range large enough to measure the assigned value. The instrument selects the best range for measuring a value of rangeValue.This attribute is primarily intended to eliminate the time that is required by the automatic range selection performed by a measuring instrument. Because selecting a fixed range prevents autoranging, an overrange condition can occur. For example, measuring 10.0 V on the 2601B, 2602B, or 2604B 6 V range or measuring 5.0 V on the 2611B, 2612B, or 2614B 2 V range causes an overrange. The value 9.91000E+37 is returned when this occurs. If the source function is the same as the measurement function (for example, sourcing voltage and measuring voltage), the measurement range is locked to be the same as the source range. However, the setting for the measure range is retained. If the source function is changed (for example, from sourcing voltage to sourcing current), the retained measurement range is used.2601B, 2602B, or 2604B example: Assume the source function is voltage. The source range is 1 V and you set the measure range for 6 V. Since the source range is 1 V, the SMU performs voltage measurements on the 1 V range. If you now change the source function to current, voltage measurements are made on the 6 V range.Explicitly setting a measure range disables measure autoranging for that function. Autoranging is controlled separately for each source and measurement function: source voltage, source current, measure voltage and measure current. Autoranging is enabled for all four by default.Changing the range while the output is off does not update the hardware settings, but querying returns the range setting that is used when the output is turned on. Setting a range while the output is on takes effect immediately.With measure autoranging enabled, the range is changed only when a measurement is made. Querying the range after a measurement returns the range selected for that measurement.",

Use a positive value for range to adjust the positive polarity and a negative value for range to adjust the negative polarity. Do not use 0.0 for a negative point; 0.0 is considered to be a positive number.Typically, the two points that are used are near zero for point 1 and 90% of full scale for point\u00a02. Full scale for point\u00a02 should be avoided if the source of the SMU is substantially out of calibration.The two reference measurements must be made with the source using the active calibration set. For example, source a value, measure it, and do not change the active calibration set before issuing this\u00a0command.The new calibration constants are activated immediately but they are not written to nonvolatile memory. Use the smuX.cal.save() function to save the new constants to nonvolatile memory. The active calibration constants stay in effect until the instrument is power cycled or a calibration set is loaded from nonvolatile memory with the smuX.cal.restore() function.This function is only available when calibration is unlocked using smuX.cal.unlock().",

During the sweep, the source generates a geometric series of ascending or descending voltage or current changes called steps. Each step is larger or smaller than the previous step by a fixed proportion. The constant of proportionality is determined by the starting value, the ending value, the asymptote, and the number of steps in the sweep. The number of source steps is one less than the number of sourced points.The points parameter does not set the number of steps in a sweep, but rather is used to calculate source values within a subsequent sweep. If the subsequent sweep has more points than specified in points, the source restarts at the beginning. This means that if the trigger count is greater than the number of points in a sweep as configured, the SMU satisfies the trigger count by restarting the sweep values from the beginning. If the subsequent sweep has fewer points than specified in points, endValue is not reached during the sweep. This means that if the trigger count is less than the number of source values configured, the SMU satisfies the trigger count and ignores the remaining source values.In cases where the first sweep point is nonzero, it may be necessary to pre-charge the circuit so that the sweep returns a stable value for the first measured point without penalizing remaining points in the sweep.With logarithmic sweeps, it is usually necessary to allow the source to autorange to maintain good source accuracy when sweeping over more than one decade or across range boundaries.The asymptote parameter customizes the inflection and offset of the source value curve. This allows log sweeps to cross zero. Setting this parameter to zero provides a conventional logarithmic sweep. The asymptote value is the value that the curve has at either positive or negative infinity, depending on the direction of the sweep.The asymptote value must not be equal to or between the starting and ending values.

This means that if the trigger count is less than the number of source values configured, the SMU satisfies the trigger count and ignores the remaining source values.In cases where the first sweep point is nonzero, it may be necessary to pre-charge the circuit so that the sweep returns a stable value for the first measured point without penalizing remaining points in the sweep.With logarithmic sweeps, it is usually necessary to allow the source to autorange to maintain good source accuracy when sweeping over more than one decade or across range boundaries.The asymptote parameter customizes the inflection and offset of the source value curve. This allows log sweeps to cross zero. Setting this parameter to zero provides a conventional logarithmic sweep. The asymptote value is the value that the curve has at either positive or negative infinity, depending on the direction of the sweep.The asymptote value must not be equal to or between the starting and ending values. It must be outside the range defined by the starting and ending values.The SMU stores only the most recent configured source action. The last call to smuX.trigger.source.linearY(), smuX.trigger.source.listY(), or smuX.trigger.source.logY() is used for the source action.Source functions cannot be changed within a sweep.After configuring the sweep source values, enable the source action by setting smuX.trigger.source.action.",

To set more than one bit of the register, set operationRegister to the sum of their decimal weights. For example, to set bits B1 and B3, set operationRegister to 10 (which is the sum of 2 + 8). ",

To set more than one bit of the register, set questionableRegister to the sum of their decimal weights.

This value indicates that bit B1 and bit B7 are\u00a0set.* Least significant bit** Most significant bitFor information about .condition, .enable, .event, .ntr, and .ptr registers, refer to Status register set contents and Enable and transition registers. The individual bits of this register are defined in the following table.As an example, to set bit B1 of the system summary 5 enable register, set status.system5.enable = status.system5.NODE57.In addition to the above constants, enableRegister can be set to the numeric equivalent of the bit to set. To set more than one bit of the register, set enableRegister to the sum of their decimal weights. For example, to set bits B1 and B4, set enableRegister to 18 (which is the sum of 2 + 16).",

This value indicates that bit B1 and bit B4 are set.* Least significant bit** Most significant bitA set bit value indicates that the specified trigger blender generated an action overrun.For information about .condition, .enable, .event, .ntr, and .ptr registers, refer to Status register set contents and Enable and transition registers. The individual bits of this register are defined in the following table.As an example, to set bit B1 of the operation status trigger blender overrun enable register, set status.operation.instrument.trigger_blender.trigger_overrun.enable = status.operation.instrument.trigger_blender.trigger_overrun.BLND1.In addition to the above constants, operationRegister can be set to the numeric equivalent of the bit to set. To set more than one bit of the register, set operationRegister to the sum of their decimal weights. For example, to set bits B1 and B4, set operationRegister to 18 (which is the sum of 2 + 16).",
