When an overrange condition occurs, the front panel displays \"Overflow\" and the remote interface returns 9.9e+37.If the source function is the same as the measurement function (for example, sourcing voltage and measuring voltage), the measurement range is the same as the source range, regardless of measurement range setting. However, the setting for the measure range is retained, and when the source function is changed (for example, from sourcing voltage to sourcing current), the retained measurement range is used.If you change the range while the output is off, the instrument does not update the hardware settings, but if you read the range setting, the return is the setting that will be used when the output is turned on.

This type of filter is the slowest, since the stack must be completely filled before an averaged sample can be produced.When the moving average filter is selected, the measurements are added to the stack continuously on a first-in, first-out basis. As each measurement is made, the oldest measurement is removed from the stack. A new averaged sample is produced using the new measurement and the data that is now in the stack.The repeating average filter produces slower results but produces more stable results than the moving average filter. For either method, the greater the number of measurements that are averaged, the slower the averaged sample rate, but the lower the noise error.

A measurement is performed at each source step (including the start and stop levels). At this level, the instrument performs another measurement and then stops the sweep.The instrument uses the step size parameter to determine the number of source level changes.

A measurement is made for each point of the sweep.When the sweep command is sent, it clears the existing trigger model and creates a new trigger model. To run the sweep, initiate the trigger model.The sweep continues until the source outputs the specified stop level. At this level, the instrument performs another measurement and then stops the sweep.When you specify a delay, a delay block is added to the sweep trigger model. This delay is added to any source delay you may have set. For example, if you set 10 ms for the source delay and 25 ms for the delay in the for the log sweep command, the actual delay is 35 ms.The range type specifies the source range that is used for the sweep. You can select the following options:You cannot use a writable reading buffer to collect data from a sweep. The asymptote changes the inflection of the sweep curve and allows it to sweep through zero. You can use the asymptote parameter to customize the inflection and offset of the source value curve. Setting this parameter to zero provides a conventional logarithmic sweep. The asymptote value is the value that the curve has at either positive or negative infinity, depending on the direction of the sweep. The asymptote value must not be equal to or between the starting and ending values. It must be outside the range defined by the starting and ending values.",
