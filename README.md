# tsp-toolkit-webhelp-to-json
This repository contains tools for converting Keithley instruments WebHelp documents into Lua definitions files. The conversion process occurs in two steps:

## 1. WebHelp to Internal JSON:
In this initial step, the tool takes a Keithley instruments WebHelp documents and converts it into an internal JSON format.

## 2. Internal JSON to Lua Definitions: 
Once the WebHelp document is converted into internal JSON, the tool proceeds to generate Lua definitions files. These Lua files are packaged into an npm package.
